 * 1 February 2016 <br>
 * <br>
 * To start the typing test start typing the second line of words.&nbsp;They will then disappear until no words are 
 * left, and at that point, the second line of words will be the first line of words.&nbsp;The words are generated from 
 * a list of the approximately ten thousand most common words.&nbsp;Once done the test, your words per minute (WPM) and 
 * characters per minute (CPM) will be displayed.&nbsp;The high score is also kept even through different instances of 
 * play.
