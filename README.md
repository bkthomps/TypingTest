# TypingTest
To start the typing test start typing the second line of words. They will then disappear until no words are left, and at that point, the second line of words will be the first line of words. The words are generated from a list of the approximately ten thousand most common words. Once done the test, your words per minute (WPM) and characters per minute (CPM) will be displayed. The high score is also kept even through different instances of play.
